and prevention measures.</p>

<summary>What is tuberculosis?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly contagious disease that primarily affects
the lungs and is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It
can also spread to other parts of your body. While curable, TB remains
a significant public health concern globally.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>How is tuberculosis transmitted?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>TB is an airborne disease. It can be transmitted through close and prolonged
exposure to an infectious individual; and is worsened by being enclosed
in areas with poor ventilation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>TB cannot be spread by contact, such as shaking someone’s hand, touching
bed linens, or toilet seats.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>What are the types of tuberculosis?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>There are two forms of TB: active and latent¹.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Active TB means the bacteria is actively multiplying and is contagious.
Latent TB means the bacteria is still present in your body, but you do
not have any symptoms and are not deemed contagious.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>What are the symptoms of tuberculosis?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Common symptoms of TB include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Persistent cough (lasting more than 3 weeks)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coughing blood or sputum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Night sweats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weight loss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fatigue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of appetite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chest pain</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Curing TB hinges on early detection. To diagnose it, your doctor may ask
you to go for a chest X-ray and put you through a series of clinical and
laboratory investigations². Untreated TB can lead to severe lung damage,
disability, or death.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Risk factors</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The risk of developing active TB is higher in those who are:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS,
diabetes, or malnutrition;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In close contact with someone with TB;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Living in crowded or poorly ventilated conditions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abusing substances (including smoking);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suffering certain medical conditions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In extremes of age (children and the elderly are more vulnerable).</p>

<summary>What should you do if you have tuberculosis?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>If you have been diagnosed with active TB, you can help keep your family,
friends, and community from getting sick by²:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Completing the full course of your medication, even if you do not have
any more symptoms or are feeling better;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staying home for the first two weeks except when attending Directly Observed
Therapy (DOT) treatment at polyclinics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wearing a face mask when near others;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covering your mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>How do you treat tuberculosis?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>TB is treated with a combination of antibiotics, administered over six
to nine months. For maximum efficacy, these antibiotics are dispensed under
the direct observation of a healthcare worker. This is called the Directly
Observed Therapy (DOT).</p>
<p></p>
<p>DOT ensures that you can be monitored to avoid treatment failure, drug
resistance, and further spread of TB². Should your condition worsen, you
may require hospitalisation or isolation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Vaccine is available³, it is only effective
in protecting babies from TB meningitis and widespread TB. It offers limited
protection against pulmonary (lung) TB, which is the most common form among
adults.</p>

<summary>About the National Tuberculosis Programme</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The National Tuberculosis Programme (NTBP) is a TB prevention and care
programme aimed at protecting the people of Singapore from the disease.
It was launched by the Ministry of Health in 1997 to further its vision
of a TB-free Singapore with people-centred care.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To spearhead NTBP and combat tuberculosis, the National Centres of Infectious
Diseases (NCID) was appointed. It uses a multi-pronged approach to control
tuberculosis; including prompt diagnosis and management of the disease;
effective contact tracing and screening; providing education and strengthening
partnerships; and implementing sustainable strategies.</p>
