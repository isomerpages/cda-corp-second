<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
<p>The Communicable Diseases Agency (CDA) is tasked with protecting Singapore
from communicable diseases. It will serve as the central authority for
designing and implementing public health policies to manage and control
the threat of infectious diseases. This includes strengthening Singapore's
public health capabilities built during the COVID-19 response, ensuring
a unified command, and coordinated approach across all situations, from
routine disease control to future outbreaks. To achieve this, the CDA will
consolidate the various public health functions currently housed within
the Ministry of Health (MOH), the National Centre for Infectious Diseases
(NCID), and the Health Promotion Board (HPB). It will also oversee the
National Public Health Laboratory. Beyond domestic activities, the CDA
aims to expand the Singaporeâ€™s global outreach and collaboration with international
partners who share similar public health goals.</p>
